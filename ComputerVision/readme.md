In Computer vision I learned the basic fundamentals of computer vision such as reading an image or video and manipulating it using the cv2 library.<br>
The concepts which I covered are,
  <ol>
    <li>Geometric Transformations (Translation, rotation, resize, flipping)</li>
    <li>Arithmatic ( arithmatic and bitwise operations )</li>
    <li>Drawing shapes in an image</li>
    <li>Function used for converting colors, blurring, edge detection</li>
    <li>Smoothing</li>
    <li>Contours (used to find shapes of an object in an image)</li>
    <li>Masking</li>
    <li>Histogram</li>
  </ol>
